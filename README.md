Useful util scripts for Bash

## forge-inspect.sh

- `forge-inspect generate [CONTRACTS]`: Generate a storage layout file for your [CONTRACTS], which should be a space separated list. It is saved as `.storage-layout`
- `forge-inspect check [CONTRACTS]` : Check the current storage layout of the contracts against an existing `.storage-layout` file. If the two layouts are not identical, it will print the `diff` and exit with `exist code 1`
- Commit the storage layout to a Git repository and have the CI run `forge-inspect check`. If the check fails, that means that the storage layout changed. The developer will need to acknowledge that difference and commit the new storage layout for the test to pass
